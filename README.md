The goal of the Orbit project is to develop an AI+Blockchain-powered decentralised bank. As a first phase we focus on developing a truly peer-to-peer lending platform, to develop *links* between different entities *chaining* their interests together. 

Orbit utilizes homomorphic encryption which allows machine learning algorithms to be trained locally on a user's device without revealing the details of the algorithm so that it cannot be modified by malicious actors, whilst preserving the privacy of the user's data.
